## Prerequisite

 - BetterDiscord
 - Dark theme on discord (won't work with white)

git clone https://gitub.com/theispacex/windows_terminal
```
**Method 2:** 

```
Download the repository directly via the website

After you have download the files, just extract into the BetterDiscord folder located on your ***%appdata%***
